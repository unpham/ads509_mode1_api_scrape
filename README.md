## ADS 509: Data Acquisition with APIs and Scraping

Acquiring data is one of the fundamental steps in any analysis and proficiency at APIs and web scraping unlocks rich data sets for future analyses. In this assignment you will scrape lyrics from AZlyrics.com.  

Instructions: 

1. Create a repository under your GitHub account from this template: https://github.com/roozbehsadeghian/ads-tm-api-scrape. Instructions can be found [here](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template). Make your repository public or add your instructor’s Github account as a [collaborator](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-user-account/managing-access-to-your-personal-repositories/inviting-collaborators-to-a-personal-repository). 
2. Choose two musical artists for your project. Both should have at least twenty songs at their artist page on AZLyrics. Those pages have forms like this: https://www.azlyrics.com/r/robyn.html. 
3. The file “API and Scrape.ipynb” holds your starting code for this assignment. 
    * This file holds starting code for the the assignment. Follow the instructions in that notebook, pulling and storing the lyrics for both artists.
    * The final part of the notebook holds evaluation code. If you’ve completed the assignment correctly, you should be able to just run this section as is. 

**Things to leave out of your repo**
1. Do not include the raw data in the repository. The `.gitignore` file is set-up ignore the `lyrics/` folder. Git attempts to track every character change in every committed file, so committing a large data file and then making any modification to it can resultin a repository that is large and hard to work with. 

Assignment Materials:
* [API and Web Scraping Repository](https://github.com/37chandler/ads-tm-api-scrape)

Deliverables:
* When you have finished your code, print your notebook as PDFs and upload these documents to Blackboard. 
* Commit your code and push the changes to GitHub so your instructor has access to the ipynb notebook files and any other code you create. 

## ADS 509: Tokenization, Normalization, and Descriptive Statistics


This assignment gives you the opportunity to practice the techniques of this module: tokenization, normalization, and calculating descriptive statistics. You will practice these skills here, then use them in every subsequent assignment.

Instructions:

Create a repository under your GitHub account from this template: https://github.com/roozbehsadeghian/ads-tm-api-scrape. Instructions can be found here. Make your repository public or add your instructor’s Github account as a collaborator.
If you did not complete the assignment for Module 1, download “M1 Assignment Data.zip” from Blackboard and extract it into your repository. This folder includes not only what you did in last module, but also information of followers of the singers on twitter.
The “Lyrics and Description EDA.ipynb” file within the repository holds the starting code and instructions for the assignment.
Work through the notebook, performing the steps asked of you. Use and extend the code from the chapters of your textbook.
Part of the data in the folder named twitter is obtained using Twitter API.
Assignment Materials:

Tokenization, Normalization, and Descriptive Statistics Repository
M1 Assignment Data.zip
Deliverables:

When you have finished your code, print both of your notebooks as PDFs and upload these documents to Blackboard.
Commit your code and push the changes to GitHub so your instructor has access to the ipynb notebook files and any other code you create.
